The included files are listed below with their descriptors:

SmartStormDrainFinalSchematic
Included is a pdf of the systems hardware wiring diagram created in EAGLE alongside the actual EAGLE .sch file used to create the device. NOTE: the layouts and footprints are inconsistent since this .sch was used solely for tracking the wiring layout and is not PCB ready.

TinkerCAD documents
There are two pieces of this as well, the first a PNG of the device mockup. The second item included is a zip file containing a .OBJ of the mockup model of the enclosure and the internal sensors. This was created in AutoDesk TinkerCAD software but should be exportable to other software suites.
