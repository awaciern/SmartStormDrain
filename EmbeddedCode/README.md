# Embedded Code
Embedded_Sensor_Ops_Code.py is the primary file that contains all sensor initializations and functions relating to interfacing and using the (2) JSN-SR04T ultrasonic distance sensors and the (1) Sparkfun Sound Detector. This file is accompanied by the tsl2591.py interface file, which enables the functionality of the (1) TSL2591 ambient light sensor. These files provide the ability to collect data for the system, but do not transmit any data. In order to transmit data, bring the functions and initializations from these files into the LoPy_Ring / LoPy_No_Ring code and integrate the sensing functions to fit the implementation of making the payload.
